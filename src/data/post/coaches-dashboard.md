## Vision
I want to do a project that does three things:
1. Attack a weak point in my programming foundation (Full Stack Dev).
2. Provide a tangible product I can show my supervisors for my new Project Engineer
internship (It is for a that provides UCaaS implementation and Solutions)
3. Do something that coincides with a current course I am taking (Intro to Database
Design) so I can kill 2 learning birds with 1 stone.

## Motivation
My new role is a solid blend of Project Management and Engineering. I may not be down in
the nitty gritty of development all the time, but I want to at a minimum be knowledgeable
on what my team is working on so my input is relevant and useful. Also I like Football so
doing any project that has to do with Football makes me happy.

## Progress
So far I have completed a home dashboard for a coach to view current team statistics and standings.
